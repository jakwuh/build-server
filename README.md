# build-server

Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner pool on a single host, powered by upstream [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) (ARC) on k3s. ARC uses GitHub's **Just-in-Time runner configs** — each pod is bound to one specific job, so there is no shared org pool and no spawn race.

This repo is the deploy scaffolding only (bootstrap script + per-scale-set helper). The runtime is upstream ARC; runner images are owned by the projects that consume them.

## Architecture

```
GitHub Actions broker ──long-poll──► ARC listener ─► ARC controller ─► k8s pod (JIT runner) ──► job
```

One **scale-set** per `(GitHub org, runner image)` pair. The scale-set's name becomes the `runs-on:` label workflows use.

## Bootstrap a host

```bash
# Fresh host (24+ vCPU, 16+ GB RAM recommended for production load):
ssh root@<HOST>
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakwuh/build-server/main/setup.sh)
```

`setup.sh` installs k3s + helm + the ARC controller into namespace `arc-systems`. Then deploy one scale-set per `(org, image)` you need.

## Deploy a scale-set

```bash
APP_ID=<github-app-id> \
INSTALL_ID=<github-app-installation-id> \
ORG=<github-org-or-user> \
NAME=<scale-set-name>           # = the runs-on: label \
IMAGE=ghcr.io/your-org/your-runner:tag \
MAX=20 \
PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/app-private-key.pem \
scripts/deploy-scale-set.sh
```

The GitHub App webhook URL is **not used** — ARC pulls from GitHub's runner broker via long-polling with the App credentials.

## Custom runner images

This repo does not ship runner images. Each project owns its image; the contract for ARC's DinD container mode is:

1. **Base on `ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner:latest`** (or any image that ships the upstream runner layout). That gets you everything below for free.
2. **`/home/runner/{run.sh,config.sh,bin,externals,k8s,env.sh,...}`** must be present. The chart's `init-dind-externals` init container `cp -r`s from `/home/runner/externals`; the runner container `exec`s `/home/runner/run.sh`. Missing either → `Init:Error` or `OCI runtime ... no such file or directory`.
3. **`runner` user must be in a group with GID 123.** The chart hardcodes `DOCKER_GROUP_GID=123` for the dind sidecar, so the docker socket ends up owned `root:123` — the runner needs that group to use it. The upstream image already puts `runner` in `docker:123`. Without it: `permission denied while trying to connect to the docker API at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.

`myoung34/github-runner` does **not** satisfy any of the above. It has no `run.sh`, no `externals/`, and its `docker` group is GID 500. Don't use it as a base — there's no clean ARC-DinD adapter that doesn't end up being a wrapper image with the missing pieces re-copied in.

## Operations

```bash
# List scale-sets and pods
kubectl get autoscalingrunnerset -A
kubectl get pods -A | grep -E '^arc-'

# Tail listener logs
kubectl -n arc-systems logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=runner-scale-set-listener -f

# Bump max runners on an existing release
helm upgrade <release> -n <namespace> --reuse-values --set maxRunners=50 \
  oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
```

## Tuning

- **Per-host capacity**: limit via `maxRunners` per scale-set + pod template resource requests.
- **Burst latency**: first pull of a runner image is slow (~1-2 min for multi-GB images). Subsequent spawns hit local cache and start in ~30s.
